# 2021 International Science and Engineering Fair

***Currently In Progress***

Paper: [doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.21249774](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.21249774)

This repo contains code for the 2021 Science and Engineering Fair.
The main idea of the project is to be able to address racial and other
inherent forms of bias in a dataset while creating a deep learning
based diagnosis for Melanoma. Full detail is in the paper. 

**Results**

As you can see from the diagram, my proposed LatentNet successfully
outperforms the conventional DCNN in 3 out of the 4 tested categories.
