# Demo Video

For the Science & Engineering Fair, I created a short video to
demonstrate the working image processing methods outlined in the 
```Image Processing``` folder in this repository. 

The video walks through specific images and applies the algorithms 
I designed to detect the amount of hair and approximate skin color of
a given dermoscopic image.
